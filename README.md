# candlestick
This project is intended to provide the software and service backend to support a kiosk application for running on dedicated communications devices. 
The name cadlestick is inspired by old 'candlestick' telephones that had few buttons and were extremely simple to operate.
The target hardware is an Android tablet, no touch screen (or at least touch screen is not used). User interface is via 3 or 4 buttons connected via a simple interface (typically the headset interface and a few resisters).

#Status
The project is currently in limited early stage development, the idea is that it can be used generally and new instances setup as needed. Within a instance it is intended to support multiple groups of users.
Users are grouped, typically based on local support and distribution of the hardware.
